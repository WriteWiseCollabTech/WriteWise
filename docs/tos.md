# WRITEWISE TERMS OF USE 

### Version: 0 [RnDAO hackathon submission 10/23/2024]

WriteWise is at this stage a prototype. These Terms of Use (as amended from time to time) should be added to any interface website where WriseWise is deployed. Please read them carefully, and consider acting accordingly so that we make Web3 a better space for all.

### 1. Acceptance. Terms of Use will be amended significantly.  

1.1. You agree that by testing, using and/or deploying the WriteWise prototype, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms. WriteWise is a prototype created by a team as part of the RnDAO CollabTech Hackathon and submitted on 23rd October 2024 (the “WriseWise Team’). These Terms of Use will be amended in the future as the project evolves. As the WriteWise prototype is deployed by various projects and on various websites, additional terms and conditions will apply, as well as various privacy policies. The WriteWise Team will not have any responsibility for any errors or omissions, any terms of use on third party websites, etc. The WriteWise team is not bound to a specific jurisdiction or legal entity at this stage. This is a prototype and requires further work and testing before deployment. Please read carefully, you are proceeding at your sole risk.

1.2. These Terms of Use will be amended significantly as the project evolves. As a general rule in Web3, please check the applicable Terms of Use every time for every app or website you use so that you understand which Terms of Use apply. Changes in Terms of Use are generally effective immediately unless otherwise provided. You will be subject to and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted the changes in any revised Terms of Use on any platform you interact with. 

### 2. Conditions of Use

If you have a doubt, check first. We will not be responsible for your actions.

2.2. You are a natural person of at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, and you are connecting to the WriseWise prototype or product at any later stage via an Externally Owned Account (EOA) which you legitimately control.
