## Deploying the webapp

Once you've followed the [Installation Guide](./installation-guide.md) and set up the WriteWise project on your local machine, you can easily deploy it to GitHub Pages by following these steps:

### 1. Build the Application

First, create a production build of the WriteWise project:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After building the application, deploy it to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will push the built files to the gh-pages branch of your repository and publish the site.

### 3. View the Deployment

Once deployed, you can access the live application at:

https://WriteWiseCollabTech.github.io/WriteWise

That's it! These simple steps will keep your GitHub Pages deployment up-to-date whenever you make changes.
