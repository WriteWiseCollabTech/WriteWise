# What is WriteWise

## A Web3 platform to amplify the impact of published papers. 

WriteWise is a prize-awarding competition platform focused on work-driven impact, amplifying the reach of technical and scientific papers through community-awarded, work-centered recognition. Using WriteWise, individuals, communities, and companies can nominate published technical and scientific papers for competitions to inspire greater, and global, awareness of scientific knowledge not typically voiced through established institutions and processes. As a prize winner or a nominee of a WriteWise competition, the platform expands authors' reach, unlocking a more meaningful, work-driven impact, and builds a stronger professional reputation. At the same time, individuals, communities, and companies can make a call for nominations along certain themes, and sponsor additional research, also raising awareness on certain topics. WriteWise supports decentralized science while awarding authors with prizes and increased visibility. The platform aspires to not only increase awareness of scientific knowledge, but in the future to bring ownership of intellectual property (IP) back to collaborators of publications and research.

## Problem

The current structure of the scientific publishing industry in unfair to knowledge producers. These knowledge producers are authors, researchers, scientists, working in Academia, in companies and independently who do not receive fair exposure for the impact they create. Usually, the impact is measured for the journal-focused models that center on the journal’s impact factor for outreach rather than the knowledge the work produced.

Before we proceed, let's clarify some key terms used in this text.

**Papers.** A paper is a published technical and scientific text, formatted in certain ways, usually peer-reviewed and published in specialized journals. The numbers are staggering: every year, traditional publishing houses receive approximately 7 million manuscript submissions. Of these, only 3 million were accepted and published in 2022, leaving 4 million rejected. There are around 50,000 journal titles worldwide. The average cost for an author to publish a single paper is about $2,000, with some journals charging up to $15,000 per published paper. These high costs and rejection rates highlight the significant challenges researchers face in disseminating their work through traditional publishing channels.

**Impact factor.** For the current scientific publishing industry, the impact factor is calculated by how many times the paper has been cited by other researchers, and these impact metrics do not consider the impact on the general public. Therefore, the impact factor is directly linked to the journal where a paper is published and has nothing to do with the impact the work produces in real life. WriteWise on the other hand, emphasizes and focuses on metrics such as quality of the work and potential applications as perceived by the general public, and by doing this is giving the public greater visibility as to existing research - Figure 1.

Figure 1. Number of manuscripts submitted per year to scientific publishing houses, number of journals' titles and journal-centered impact factor.

**Readers as consumers of knowledge.** Consumers are not only scholars who will use papers for expanding knowledge and building on top for their projects and ideas, but also those who will use in real world applications such as scientists, researchers, academics, students, educational institutions, libraries, industry professionals, companies, government and policymakers, other scientific publishers and journals, investors and venture capitalists and, the general public.

**The status quo is limiting.** To publish in traditional high-impact journals, authors and organizations often face several barriers: a) high publication fees, b) affiliation with specific research centers or labs, and c) a focus on particular types of research or themes. Together, these factors significantly limit the number of individuals, groups, and ideas that can gain visibility and make an impact with their work. This restricts access to distribution channels for underfunded researchers and organizations, reducing the diversity of narratives on various problems, themes, or areas of knowledge. As a result, the overall body of knowledge is shaped by a few distribution groups, limiting broader perspectives and contributions.

**The lost value of knowledge producers.** The current structure of the scientific publishing industry is unfair to knowledge producers. These knowledge producers are authors, researchers, and scientists, working in Academia, in companies and independently who do not receive fair exposure for the impact they create. Usually, the impact is measured for the journal-focused models that center on the journal’s impact factor for outreach rather than the knowledge of the work produced by individuals who authored and collaborated on the publication. Individuality is lost through the arcane processes of centralized institutions and the focus on the capitalization of journal sales to prestigious, paywalled outlets.

WriteWise breaks away from conventional publishing, leveraging authors published in decentralized platforms, giving them proof of impact and incentives for them to keep publishing on these decentralized science-DeSci platforms. We encourage quality vs. formality, making research papers more accessible to the general public, and giving researchers insights about how their research can be useful in the real world. WriteWise will help diffuse good research papers irrespective of whether they are published in fancy peer-reviewed journals, on DeSci platforms or elsewhere.

## Market Size

The market size for a prize-award platform for relevant scientific research can be estimated by looking at several key interconnected sectors:

**First, the academic publishing market is bigger than the cinema industry.** The global academic publishing industry was valued at approximately $28 billion in 2023 and is expected to continue growing [1], [2]. The cinema industry was evaluated at $26 billion in 2022 [3].

**Industry R&D Spending.** Global R&D spending reached approximately $2.4 trillion in 2023, with industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and technology being major drivers. A platform that connects research with industry applications and allows for direct community engagement could target this market, securing 5-10% of industry-sponsored research outreach through decentralized solutions.

**Blockchain and Web3 markets.** The blockchain market is projected to reach $67.4 billion by 2026, with applications across various industries, including decentralized finance, intellectual property management, and digital asset ownership [4]. 

**Global education market.** The global education technology market, which includes online learning platforms and research tools, is expected to exceed $404 billion by 2025. A decentralized platform offering competition based on impactful content could tap into this growing demand, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries, addressing the needs of students, educators, and researchers [5].

**Overlooked Markets.** In 2023, approximately 2 million bachelor's degrees were awarded by postsecondary institutions in the United States of America alone. This figure reflects the ongoing trends in higher education, with business, health professions, and social sciences being among the most popular fields of study in the USA [6]. In Brazil, this number is also high, with approximately 1.4 million bachelor's degrees awarded in 2023 [7]. These graduates must present capstone projects, which often remain unpublished due to a lack of suitable channels to showcase their research and have it recognized as valuable by society. 

**Estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM).** Combining the academic publishing, blockchain, education technology, R&D funding sectors, and potentially publishable capstone work from individuals receiving bachelor’s degree the total addressable market for this platform could range from $30 to $35 billion, with the potential to grow as decentralized solutions gain adoption and as more consumers and industries embrace open, transparent, and direct engagement with research.

## Proposed Solution

A web3 platform to amplify the impact of published papers through a prize-awarding app: the WriteWise solution can be used composably and collaboratively by many publishing platforms and communities. WriteWise emphasizes a more expansive audience of publications as a key aspect not typically found within the scientific publishing industry. WriteWise shifts the focus to work-centered impact, where the merit of each paper is directly recognized by the community, unlike traditional journal-focused models that center on the journal’s impact factor for outreach. Using WriteWise, individuals, communities, and companies can nominate published technical and scientific papers for competitions, with prizes based on voting. 

WriteWise favors decentralized science (DeSci) and independent research publishing platforms.

The WriteWise platform will utilize blockchain for transparent tracking of nominations, voting and prize-awarding, enabling smart contracts transactions and mechanisms such as token-based incentives and community-based recognition in the form of prizes. This would ensure that scientific papers and peer-reviewed preprints create impact for their intellectual contributions.

Winning a WriteWise competition allows authors to expand their reach, create meaningful, work-driven impact, and gain additional funding for their work directly or through reputation. At the same time, WriteWise will allow anyone interested to sponsor a competition and gather good quality research papers for a comprehensive literature review around a certain topic, which could be a first step towards applied research.

The impact factor system created by the industry is an exclusionary approach that entrenches a high-cost, journal-centered paradigm, which is especially harmful to underfunded institutions, companies, individuals, and independent researchers. Therefore, impact should be redirected towards the consumer side—the individuals and organizations who use that knowledge. Universities, independent researchers, students, and companies are all key stakeholders in this system. 

What is the coolest piece of science I have read lately? What was a striking takeaway message from a specific paper I came across? Who represented a project with a beautiful graphic? Which paper was delightfully simple to understand even though it addressed a complex theme? These are all valid questions for an award-winning published paper.

The traditional model often imposes its own journal-centered 'impact factor.' Typically, the higher the price per paper (which can reach up to around $15,000 USD per paper), the higher the so-called impact factor. This model limits the community's ability to judge valuable knowledge, hindering the collection of information for the 'true impact' or 'impact contribution' of a published paper from any given author or university, regardless of whether they have funds to pay for publication.

By implementing a prize-awarding app, consumers will have a chance to have their say and create true community-sourced impact for published papers outside siloed, high-cost journals that have self-designated themselves as high-impact.

With token-based incentives, consumers will be able to directly vote on the knowledge they value, fostering a more collaborative relationship between knowledge producers and consumers. This democratization of knowledge consumption is likely to enhance scientific understanding, inclusivity, and the wider dissemination of cutting-edge research from many parts of the world.

## Why Web3 and Why Arbitrum

So, why web3? What are the advantages over a web2 infrastructure? Besides the commonly cited advantages of web3 such as enhanced security, transparency, user control, automation (nominations, voting and prize-awarding, automatically enabled by smart contracts transactions), and cost efficiency,  incorporating blockchain technology into prize nominations and awards can significantly enhance fairness through global accessibility, trust, user experience and credibility to create reputation records of impact for both the nominees and the winners. Prizes and nominations minted on NFTs can offer verifiable digital certificates of achievement.

A token-based incentive mechanism can be built on top of the WriteWise app.

WriteWise leverages the power of the crypto economy for a public good. The Web3 crowd is full of smart people from various backgrounds, often scientific. This project will bridge the gap between DeFi and DeSci, linking the two communities together in very beneficial ways for both.

The Arbitrum platform continues to gain popularity among users [7]. But Arbitrum needs more use cases outside DeFi since one of the serious drawbacks of the Arbitrum platform is its limited focus on the leading decentralized applications on this platform exclusively in the DeFi sector. In this project we are building a decentralized science-DeSci solution which increases Arbitrum usage for a different use case.

## Potential Impact

As a prize-awarding app, several strategies can be employed to maximize WriteWise reach and effectiveness:

**Incentivize Community Participation:** Introduce mechanisms for the general public to engage in the knowledge ecosystem, such as nominating and voting on impactful research. This alignment can drive consumer interests with the platform's success, creating a dynamic collaborative community that values knowledge and actively contributes to its growth.

**Integrate gamification:** Implement gamified elements to encourage broader participation from students, researchers, sponsors/donors, and the general public. Features like leaderboards, badges, or rewards for engaging with and promoting quality content can drive more interaction and create a sense of accomplishment for consumers and producers alike.

**Expand accessibility:** Ensure the platform is easily accessible globally, including in regions where access to scientific research is traditionally limited. Offering multilingual support and mobile-friendly interfaces can broaden the platform’s reach to underserved communities.

**Partnerships with forward-looking educational platforms:** Forge partnerships with decentralized platforms, independent peer-reviewing platforms, cutting-edge communities, communities working with frontier and new areas of knowledge, to integrate the platform into their existing structures. These partnerships would increase visibility, attract more consumers, and validate the platform as a credible alternative to traditional impact contribution and opinion formation.

**Crowdsourced recognition:** Implement a decentralized, community-driven nomination and voting system that allows the audience to recognize and reward high-quality impactful research from the consumer standpoint. This could democratize the process, increasing transparency and fairness of scientific contributions, while enabling consumers to directly participate in assessing and promoting valuable content.

**Tokenized prizes for knowledge sharing and reputation building:** Introduce an award economy where consumers can earn tokens for contributing to the platform by nominating, reviewing, and ultimately promoting research. This encourages engagement and helps establish an active, thriving ecosystem where both producers and consumers are incentivized.

**Certificates of achievement:**  Prizes and nominations minted on NFTs can offer verifiable digital certificates of achievement.

**Collaborate with industry partners:** Engage with industry stakeholders who benefit from cutting-edge research and knowledge, such as biotech firms, tech companies, and new policy makers. These partnerships can amplify the impact by driving more funding into research and helping knowledge producers connect directly with real-world applications of their work.

**Leverage AI and data analytics:** Use AI tools to match consumers with relevant content, providing personalized research recommendations, and improving discoverability of niche or emerging fields. 

## The potential impact of implementing these solutions is significant and multifaceted.

By introducing WriteWise as prize-awarding app for published papers, several potential impacts can be anticipated:

**Empowering Knowledge Producers:** Researchers and creators will receive direct financial rewards for their contributions, increasing motivation and enabling them to focus more on innovation rather than navigating institutional barriers. Prizes and nominations minted on NFTs can offer verifiable digital certificates of achievement.

**Democratizing Access to Knowledge:** By reducing paywalls and subscription fees, more people worldwide—especially those in underfunded regions—can access cutting-edge research, closing knowledge gaps and fostering global collaboration.

**Fostering Innovation and Collaboration:** A tokenized reward system and crowdsourced peer review encourage higher-quality research, transparency, and faster dissemination of knowledge, leading to more rapid advancements across various fields.

**Creating a Self-Sustaining Ecosystem:** By aligning the interests of producers, consumers, and industry partners, the platform can create a virtuous cycle of knowledge creation, sharing, and funding, promoting continuous growth.

**Enhancing Industry Applications:** Industry partnerships would connect scientific research with real-world solutions, speeding up the transfer of new discoveries into practical applications, benefitting society at large.

**Personalized Knowledge Consumption:** With AI-driven recommendations, consumers will find the most relevant content faster, improving learning outcomes and contributing to more informed decision-making across academic, industrial, and policy domains.

These impacts will help build a more equitable, transparent, and efficient knowledge ecosystem that benefits both creators and consumers, ultimately driving societal progress and innovation.
