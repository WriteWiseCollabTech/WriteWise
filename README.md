# WriteWise
A Web3 platform dedicated to amplifying the impact of scientific papers and peer-reviewed preprints. WriteWise shifts the focus to work-centered impact, where the merit of each paper is directly recognized by the community, unlike traditional journal-focused models that center on the journalâ€™s impact factor for outreach. Using WriteWise, individuals, communities, and companies can nominate published technical and scientific papers for competitions, with rewards based on voting.
Favoring decentralized science (DeSci) and independent research, WriteWise breaks away from conventional publishing, maintaining authors' copyrights and enabling royalty streams. Winning a WriteWise competition allows authors to expand their reach, create meaningful, work-driven impact, and build a strong professional reputation.
