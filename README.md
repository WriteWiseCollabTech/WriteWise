# A Web3 platform to amplify the impact of published papers. 

WriteWise is a prize-awarding competition platform focused on work-driven impact, amplifying the reach of technical and scientific papers through community-awarded, work-centered recognition.

Using WriteWise, individuals, communities, and companies can nominate published technical and scientific papers for competitions to inspire greater, and global, awareness of scientific knowledge not typically voiced through established institutions and processes. As a prize winner or a nominee of a WriteWise competition, the platform expands authors' reach, unlocking a more meaningful, work-driven impact, and builds a stronger professional reputation. At the same time, individuals, communities, and companies can make a call for nominations along certain themes, and sponsor additional research, also raising awareness on certain topics.

WriteWise supports decentralized science while awarding authors with prizes and increased visibility. The platform aspires to not only increase awareness of scientific knowledge, but in the future to bring ownership of intellectual property (IP) back to collaborators of publications and research.
